# Solo Cup/Team Games

## Beer Pong

*Good team game, not likely to get drunk.*


## Flip Cup

*Better than beer pong.*


## Boat Race

*No tactics. Just drink. Only for large teams.*

1. Each team member stands next to each other.
2. One at a time they have to down their drink as fast as they can.
3. Once done, turn the cup upside down on your head.
4. Only then can the next person continue.
5. First team to finish wins.


## Slap Cup

*High speed group game.*

1. Everyone splits a tinnie across three solo cups each, and groups all the cups together in the middle.
2. Each person stands around the table in a circle.
3. Two people opposite each other are given an empty cup and a ping pong ball.
4. They must bounce the ball so it lands in their cup. Once it lands in the cup, they then pass the empty ball and cup to another player.
5. If they land it the cup and the other player is immediately to their right, they can slap that player's cup of the table. That player must now down a drink from the centre and continue with this new cup.
6. The game is over once all cups have been drunk.

*Fantastic way to bully one individual.*

2. Higher or lower?
3. In between or outside?

## Pyramid/Fuck You

*Simple, great game for strangers.*

1. Arrange the cards face down in a pyramid with five layers.
2. Deal the remaining cards to the players.
3. Starting from the base of the pyramid, turn over a card.
4. If you have a matching value card, you can choose to place it on top and say "Fuck you {someone's name}", dealing out a sip to them.
5. The number of sips you can dish out increases with each layer of the pyramid.

# Dice Games

## Liar's Dice

*Requires a significant amount of brain wattage.*

1. Everyone is given a solo cup and 5 dice.
2. Shake the dice around in the cup and turn it upside down on the table, covering your dice.
3. Look at your dice, but don't show anyone else.
4. One at a time, anounce your bet on how many of a certain number there are in total (e.g. five 3s).
5. Each person must **either** make a higher bet (e.g. five 4s) **or** call their predecessor out as a liar.
6. If you get called out as a liar, everyone must reveal their dice. If you are indeed a liar, drink. Otherwise, the caller drinks.

## Shot Roulette

*Like Russian Roulette but more painful.*

1. Fill 6 shot glasses (5 with water, 1 with spirit). Mix them up and then place each glass on a playing card labelled 1 (ace) to 6.
2. Each player rolls a die. Whichever number comes up, that's the shot you take.
3. *Optionally, eliminate this player and repeat until there's just one survivor.*

# Paper Games

## Straight Face

*For the giggles.*

1. Everyone writes something funny on a piece of paper, folds it up and mixes it in the middle.
2. One at a time, each person reads the contents of a paper from the middle. If they laugh, they drink.

## The Circle Game

*You pick the rules.*

1. Everyone sits around a piece of paper/pizza box.
2. One at a time, each person flips a bottle cap onto the card. If it lands on an empty space, draw a circle around the landing site and write a rule there. If it lands on an existing rule, carry out the rule.

# No Equipment Games

## Roxanne

*Low effort, can socialise simultaneously.*

1. Play a song (like Roxanne). Every time a certain word or phrase (like Roxanne) is sung, drink.

## Never Have I Ever

*It's in the title.*

## Two Truths One Lie

*It's in the title.*

## Medusa

*Great for a small group to get drunk fast.*

1. Everyone stands in a circle, side by side and puts their heads together, looking at the floor.
2. On the count of three, everyone lifts their heads and looks at another person.
3. If two people find themselves looking at each other, the last one to say "medusa" has to drink a shot.

# Good Friend Games

## Paranoia

*For a group of close friends.*

1. Everyone sits in a circle.
2. One at a time, whisper a question to the person on your right along the lines of "who's most likely to...".
3. The person on your right has to answer aloud to the group with another person's name.
4. If that person drinks, the question must be revealed.

## Back to Back

*For a pair of close friends.*

1. Two friends sit/stand back to back.
2. Everyone else asks them questions along the lines of "who's most likely to...".
3. They raise their hand if they think the answer is themself.
4. If they disagree with each other (i.e. both raise their hands or neither of them do), then they both have to drink.
